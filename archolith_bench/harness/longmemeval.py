"""LongMemEval adapter — official long-term memory QA benchmark.

Dataset: LongMemEval (Wu et al., ICLR 2025) — chat assistants answering questions
that require recalling facts across long, multi-session histories. Measures the
five memory abilities: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal
reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention.

This is the capability benchmark for a memory system (menhir is built on Graphiti,
the same temporal-KG engine Zep reports on LongMemEval/DMR). Run as a direct-vs-
proxy A/B: the proxy assembles relevant memory from the history, so the claim is
memory-QA accuracy preserved/improved while tokens drop.

Online use needs the `longmemeval` extra (`datasets`); offline reads a fixture.

Scoring note: the official benchmark uses a GPT-4 judge. This adapter ships a
deterministic normalized scorer (good for factual answers, offline, no judge
spend). It rejects obvious negated-answer false positives; an LLM-judge scorer
can still be added behind a flag later for official evidence runs.
