"""Read-only bolt reader for the Menhir ScalarStateView (Piece C) e2e harness.

Piece C is a SHADOW build: nothing user-facing reads a `scalar_state` View yet, so Menhir's HTTP
recall/bootstrap surface will NOT show them. The only way to verify the materialized state is to query
the graph directly over bolt. This helper wraps the three verification queries from the handoff
(`menhir/.agent/for-review/HANDOFF-2026-07-20-scalar-state-end-to-end-testing.md`, section 7):

    * `read_typed_assertions`   -- the durable `:TypedAssertion` event log the LLM produced
    * `read_scalar_state_views` -- the materialized current `scalar_state` Views (one per slot)
    * `read_pending_advisories` -- assertions awaiting a unique binding (`unbound:<source_key>`)

SAFETY: this opens a driver against a THROWAWAY menhir Neo4j only. The online tests / probes run
unscoped reads; pointing at prod would read the operator's real memories. `assert_not_prod` refuses
the known prod endpoints, mirroring the `force_all_tests_onto_test_neo4j` discipline in menhir's
conftest. The reader issues READ transactions only -- it never writes.
