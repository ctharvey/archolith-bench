"""Phase D — counterfactual recall evaluation for ScalarStateView (OFFLINE, no menhir recall change).

Compares, per current-state question, a BASELINE recall (menhir's live graph/episode recall over HTTP)
against a VIEW-AWARE answer composed HERE in the harness from the current `scalar_state` Views. Nothing
in production recall changes and no user-facing suppression happens: the View-aware answer is a pure
counterfactual, so we can measure whether trusting a current View WOULD improve recall before ever
wiring authority into the live path.

Seven dimensions are scored SEPARATELY per question (never collapsed into one rate):
  1. current_state_detected  -- the question asks for a CURRENT standing value (not history);
  2. subject_resolved        -- the View/assertion subject is the entity the question is about;
  3. slot_overlap            -- the question's attribute maps EXACTLY to a current View slot;
  4. view_status             -- the selected View's value vs ground-truth current: correct|wrong|absent;
  5. stale_in_baseline       -- baseline recall surfaced the STALE predecessor value;
  6. answer_improved         -- View-aware gives the current answer where baseline is stale/ambiguous;
  7. wrongful_suppression    -- View-aware would suppress a fact that is ACTUALLY still valid (must be 0).

PRIMARY Phase D metrics are computed ONLY over rows where view_status == "correct" (so a MISSING View is
never confused with WRONG USE of an available one). End-to-end coverage across ALL questions is reported
separately.

Methodology (frozen, same as the coverage matrix): every live measurement uses a FRESH ISOLATED
menhir+neo4j stack. The gate stays k=3 / threshold=1.0 (step 5 frozen); a 2/3 shadow A/B comes later.
