"""Pluggable answer scorers for the memory harness.

The default `containment` scorer (longmemeval._score_answer) is fast and offline but
is NOT how the field reports LongMemEval: the official protocol and the published
Mem0/Zep numbers use an LLM judge (a GPT-4-class model decides correctness). To make
our accuracy comparable to those, this provides an LLM-judge scorer with the same
shape as `adapter.score(item, response_text) -> bool`.

For a publishable, apples-to-apples number use the same judge model the field uses
(gpt-4o); gpt-4o-mini is the cheaper default for internal runs.
