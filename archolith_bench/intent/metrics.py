"""Metrics for the intent benchmark.

Headline metric is role-based intent-correct@1: did the top-1 ranked candidate carry a
role that is PREFERRED for the query's classified intent? This is robust to ties among
several preferred-role candidates (the design's point is that intent surfaces a
*task-appropriate* artifact first, not one exact id). nDCG (for the no-harm arm) is
reused from the oracle bench.
