# One-item build that PROVES menhir's ingest backdating works, before committing to a full re-ingest.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The 2026-07-22 scalar-ku corpus had 1707/2862 episodes stamped with their INGESTION time instead of
# the conversation time. Two defects stacked:
#   1. menhir's claim_pending_episode projected queued_at but NOT reference_time, so the enrichment
#      handoff silently fell back to queue time (fixed: menhir 27d9bad).
#   2. build_graph.sh then ran backfill_dates.py unconditionally to "repair" it -- but that script
#      keys off e.session_id, which graphiti-written EpisodicNodes do not carry, so it skipped
#      exactly the 62% that were broken and printed success anyway.
# The repair masked the bug. So this smoke runs with LME_BACKFILL_DATES=0: the dates in the resulting
# graph are the INGEST's dates, unassisted, and the verifier checks them against the fixture.
#
# THE ITEM: cc5ded98, a knowledge-update question whose answer depends entirely on valid_at ordering.
#   session 0  2023-05-25  "about an hour each day"
#   session 1  2023-05-27  "about two hours each day"   <- the correct answer
# In the old corpus 42 of its 45 episodes carried a wrong date. If backdating is broken, both
# sessions land at ingest time and "which is current" is decided by import order, not world time.
#
# ISOLATION: its own container, volume, ports and manifest. It cannot touch the canonical LME graph
# (menhir-lme-neo4j / menhir-lme-data) or the 7701 snapshot.

# Usage:  bash scripts/longmemeval/run_date_smoke.sh
