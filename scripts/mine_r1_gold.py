"""Mine an R1 gold answer set from the DUMMY graph (prod clone on bolt 7687).

Why: the only R1 fixture (`fixtures/r1_demo.json`) saturates at recall=1.0, so the
ladder can never graduate and `hybrid_alpha` stays unset. The dummy is a full clone of
the live menhir graph (23k+ real Entity nodes with `structure_project`/`symbol_kind`/
`symbol_signature`), so we can derive GOLD LABELS mechanically for the three families
the R1 win gate actually needs, with real recall headroom:

  symbol_name_query   DESCRIBE a distinctive class (LLM paraphrase of its body, no
                      identifier overlap) so the source-aware floor must rescue the gold;
                      gold = that one node (globally unique name) -> drives `symbol_recall`
                      with real headroom. Raw-identifier fallback when no LLM client / the
                      body is too thin (saturates -> exempt under the recalibrated gate);
                      the `vehicle` field records which was used. (Needs a client, i.e.
                      run with --paraphrase; the de-CamelCased spacing vehicle is removed.)
  exact_error_string  query a distinctive underscore identifier (function/method name)
                      VERBATIM; gold = that node -> drives `exact_string_recall` (saturates
                      -- a floor/no-regression guard, exempt from the gate's must-beat).
  wrong_repo_same_topic  a symbol name that exists in EXACTLY two projects; query = a
                      paraphrase of project A's node body (identifier removed, so the scope
                      warden -- not lexical match -- must pick A), gold = the project-A node,
                      the project-B node is a real wrong-scope distractor -> drives
                      `wrong_scope_injection_rate`. Raw-identifier fallback as above.

  paraphrased_debug_question  (opt-in, --paraphrase N, needs OPENAI_API_KEY) an LLM rewrites a
                      node's own summary into a natural question that SHARES NO identifier
                      words with the node -> lexically distant, semantically dead-on. gold =
                      that uuid; target_symbol = its name (so a successful semantic-gap rescue
                      moves `symbol_recall`, where the dummy has real headroom). This is the
                      family that most directly exercises R1's source-aware floor; the
                      symbol/scope families now share this same paraphrase vehicle (with a
                      raw-identifier fallback), so they get semantic-gap headroom too, while
                      exact stays verbatim as a saturating floor guard. See
                      `.agent/benchmark-notes/r1-dummy-gold-run.md`.

NOT mined (honest scope): `stale_semantic_neighbor` / `historical_only_vs_current_truth`
(the clone's `conflict_status` has no `superseded`/historical marker, only
`false_positive`/`resolved`) and `buried_relevant_memory` (needs an LLM judge). Those stay
with the `_eval_frontier.py` judge path or a hand-authored fixture (drop hand-authored
queries into the same JSON — the runner scores them identically). So every mined memory
carries `stale=false`; `stale_hit_rate` is therefore 0 for all conditions and the win gate's
"no stale regression" check is trivially satisfied — documented, not hidden.

Memory ids ARE the node uuids, so the read-mode runner (`run_r1_dummy.py`) maps recall
results straight back to gold with no seed-episode grounding step.

READ-ONLY graph access. Opens one driver against the dummy and only runs MATCH ... RETURN.
Never writes, never touches prod (prod is a different bolt host in menhir/.env). With
--paraphrase it additionally makes N one-shot LLM calls (gpt-4.1-nano) to author questions.

Run:  python scripts/mine_r1_gold.py [--out fixtures/r1_dummy_gold.json]
