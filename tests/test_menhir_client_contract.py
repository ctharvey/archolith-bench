"""Contract tests for HttpMenhirClient -- the client the real LME ingest actually uses.

Why this file exists: HttpMenhirClient had NO test coverage, so a `diff` reference was added
to `ingest()`'s body without adding it to `ingest()`'s signature. Every test passed (they all
drive StubMenhirClient, which DID get the parameter) while every real ingest died with
`NameError: name 'diff' is not defined`. It surfaced only when a live LME build was attempted.

Two guards, both cheap:
  1. signature parity between the stub and the real client -- a param added to one must be
     added to the other, which is what actually drifted.
  2. exercise the real ingest()/ingest_raw() bodies against a fake transport, so an unresolved
     name in the payload-building path fails here instead of a day into a graph build.
